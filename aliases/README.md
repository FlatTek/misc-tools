## Installation

To get started with these tools, simply place the scripts in a directory that is in your PATH. You can clone the repository to get all the scripts:

I recommend creating a `bin` directory in your user profile directory and adding it to your PATH. This way, you can easily manage all your scripts in one place.

```bash
cd %USERPROFILE%
mkdir bin
setx PATH "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\bin"
cd bin
```

Then, copy the scripts you want to use into the `bin` directory.
