# Misc Tools

Just a collection of tools for making your life easier.

Some I have written... others I have collected over the years.

I do a lot of work at the command line, and miss some of the tools that are available on Linux/Unix systems.  So this collection begins to bridge that gap.  I know most are available in packages like Cygwin, but I wanted to have them available without having to install a package since sometimes that is not an option.
