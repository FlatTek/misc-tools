# Misc Tools

Welcome to the **Misc Tools** repository! This collection is designed to make your life easier by providing a variety of tools, some of which I've written myself, while others have been curated over the years. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or just someone who enjoys working at the command line, you'll find something useful here.

## Introduction

In my daily work, I often find myself missing some of the handy tools available on Linux/Unix systems. This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing a collection of tools that can be used without the need for extensive installations like Cygwin. These tools are lightweight, easy to use, and can be a great addition to your workflow.

## Features

- **Command Line Utilities**: A variety of tools to enhance your command line experience.
- **Cross-Platform**: Tools that work seamlessly on different operating systems.
- **Lightweight**: No need for heavy installations; just download and use.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the tools to fit your specific needs.

## Installation

To get started with these tools, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlatTek/misc-tools.git
cd misc-tools
```

No additional installation steps are required. Just ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.

## Usage

Each tool comes with its own documentation and usage instructions. Here are a few examples:

### SUDO: A Simple `sudo` Implementation for Windows

This is a simple `sudo` implementation for Windows. It is a command line tool that lets you run commands as admin, just like you would on Linux/Unix or OS X.

```bash
sudo Notepad
```

### WhereIs: A Simple `whereis` Implementation for Windows

This is a simple `whereis` implementation for Windows. It is a command line tool that lets you find the location of a program in your PATH.

```bash
whereis notepad.exe
```

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the individual tool's README file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a tool that you think would be a great addition to this collection, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/tool-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new tool'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/tool-name`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

Please ensure your contributions adhere to the repository's coding standards and include appropriate documentation.  At this time, I am not accepting new tools unless they are scripts (no compiled code), and I am accepting bug fixes and improvements.
