# MENU - A simple menu system for the command line.

In this folder you will find two menu scripts. One for DOS and one for Linux/Unix. These scripts provide a simple menu system for the command line, allowing you to easily navigate through a list of menu panels to remind you of commands or other details you have stored in the menu.

## Features

- Type `menu` to start the menu system.
- Type `menu [topic]` to display a specific topic you have saved.
- Type `menu edit [topic]` to edit a specific topic (or create a new one).

The menu system uses NANO as the editor, so make sure you have it installed on your system or change the editor in the script.

## Installation

To get started with the menu system, simply place the scripts in a directory that is in your PATH... preferrably ~/bin .

The first time you run the script it will make a directory in your home directory called `.menu` and create a sample menu file for you to get started.

That is about it. Enjoy!
